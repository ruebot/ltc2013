Question 2: Are your storage needs for large object, small objects, or combination of both? Question 3: Where do you look for storage solutions? Library IT, Campus IT, Partnerships, Commercial?</p>

<p class="notes">I'm going to go a couple of tangents here before I get to the meat of the presentations. So, please bear with me and hopefully this will all make sense in the end. In my first tangent, I'm going to try and convey some broad observations about working in two completely different organizations. I am not trying to say one organization is better than the other, or get up here and pile on McMaster, because I'm not sure how much more they can take. And! In all honestly, I loved the team of folks I worked with there. I just didn't like this one guy.</p>

<p class="notes">You can be really bleeding edge. Jump on every new technology the second it comes out. And maybe even run your production servers on Arch, updating twice a day. Or you can be slow as molasses, overly-cautious to a fault, and extremely conservative; like only upgrading your Wordpress instance one a year. NO! NO! NO! There has to be a balance somewhere in there. Ideally, something with balanced traits: lean, agile, nimble, responsive, adaptive. </p>

<p class="notes">When I was back a McMaster we had about 20TB of data that we needed to have a preservation copy stored somewhere. Duracloud/portico, etc where not an option due to cost (I'll speak more to that in a bit). I knew that a Scholars Portal was going through TRAC Certification (trustworthy digital repository), so I asked a colleague there what they were doing for off-site preservation. Long story short, we realized that our "collections" were around the same size, and initially planned on mirroring our content at each institution. From there (after talking to our bosses about this, it expanded into a conversation into how can we do this cosortially, and we've been working on that ever since.</p>

<p class="notes">We've identified a need to provide archival storage capacity for digitized and born-digital collections. Right now, we have a few options, but they fall between the polar extremes of Glacier (at $10/TB) or DuraCloud using Rackspace or S3 (at $1300/TB). Duracloud/S3/Rackspace are not sustainable as collections grow in size, and Glacier is not sustainable insofar as lacking the ability to audit fixity information in a way that is not cost prohibitive due to bandwidth costs. Moreover, all of these solutions are not within Canadian jurisdiction. We need something that is not susceptible to the Patriot Act and the like.</p>

<h1>DIGITAL PRESERVATION</h1>

<p class="notes">This is something I seemingly have to combat over and over again on the hard IT and administration side of things. Backups are NOT digital preservation. Let's say that one more time. BACKUPS ARE NOT DIGITAL PRESERVATION. Backups are a part of digital preservation, but have a backup is not digital preservation.

<h1>Storage Hierarchies</h1>
</div>
</div><div class="slide" data-transition="none"><div class="content center" ref="slides/01-nruest/23">
<p class="notes">Print libraries have used a hierarchical model for storing content for many years. High use material is kept on reserve. Core collections are kept in stacks close to users, and low-use material are kept in off-site storage facilities. Storage requirements for digital libraries similarly map to hierarchical terms as well. In this generalized graphic, we have high-availability services (indexes and transactional databases) at the top, beneath that we have we have content that researchers and students use on a daily basis (journal articles, eBooks, and other published resources), then at the bottom we have tape storage services that provide high-capacity, low-cost replication, and off-site distribution of the data with very lengthy retrieval times.</p>

<p class="notes">Yep, I totally skipped over one. Archival storage of digital objects requires storage with very high-capacity, mid-range retrieval speeds, all at a low cost. This type of storage is generally very difficult for libraries to acquire. It is not normally available through central IT, and the commercial options have lots of drawbacks. Let's see what our options are.</p>

<p class="notes">S3 is Amazon's established service for high availability cloud storage. If I decided to use S3 for that 20TB collection I mentioned earlier, I'd be looking at a $85k/yr bill. In the context of dark archiving, Glacier is of great interested with its $10/TB price point. But, it is a mostly untested service for archiving digital objects given the bandwidth costs. For example, to perform fixity checks once a year on 150TB, it would cost approximately $27,000.</p>

<p class="notes">Rackspace is a cloud services company that provides services very similar to Amazon AWS, and mimics Amazon's APIs. Pricing is very similar to Amazon's S3 services - so, something like that $85k/yr price point for the 20TB collection. Currently they do not offer a comparable service to Glacier.</p>

<h1>Community Storage Clouds</h1>

<p class="notes">Private or community based storage clouds are what we're looking at as an alternative to commercial cloud services. By using an open source stack like Openstack (which John will talk about more in a bit), we would not be tied to a particular hardware vendor, thereby allowing us to build our own solution with commodity hardware. Some more advantages include: reducing bandwidth charges, and allowing us to maintain physical control over hardware.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="slide" data-transition="none"><div class="content center" ref="slides/01-nruest/31">
<p class="notes">COMPONENTS (read the points): 1) off-the-shelf storage arrays using consumer-grade disk drives 2) middleware takes care of replication and automatic restoration of data from failed disks 3) routing data across geographic areas 4) Openstack API which is basically the S3 API 5) Remote management -- web based interface for users/institutions 6) scale out to 100s of petabytes 7) Now over to John to talk more about a potential hardware and software solutions.</p>

<h3>Geographic diversification</h3>

<h3>Block and object storage using a common API</h3>

<p class="notes">So this company Backblaze, which is itself a cloud hosting provider ala Dropbox, Amazon etc. etc., did something sort of amazing. They engineered a relatively-super cheap box that is designed to be populated with cheap-ish desktop drives.  <em>Then</em> they released the design of the box for free for anybody to implement. Think open source software, but for hardware, like an Arduino. The cheapness of this allows them to treat the entire box as a FRU, so they have a chunk of them sitting around and when one box fails they can slide in another.</p>

<p><img src="./file/slides/images/box-open.jpg" width="667" height="500" alt="images/box-open.jpg"/>

<p class="notes">So here's a picture of the pod we have. It has 45 bays, of which we are currently using 15, but we plan on maxing out to 45 in production. At 3TB each, that gives us 135 TB of storage of a price at about $10k, compared to (I think?) $2 MILLION over three years for comparable storage on Amazon S3. The drives are nothing special, they're all just whatever you'd have in your desktop. This allows us to cut costs by big chunk by not buying server ready type drives. All it basically is is a normal desktop PC with a ton of drives in it and a bunch of sorta-redundant power supplies and fans and such. Turning it on sounds like a jet engine, so you don't want to have this on your desktop. It's a straight x86 machine, so whatever Linux or so you want to shove in it will work. Dig those rubber bands around the drives -- those are shock absorbers! </p>

<ul>
<li>... easily spin up server space for projects</li>
<li>... do that fun Big Data stuff you've heard about</li>
<li>... do lots of backups</li>
</ul>

<p class="notes">This might be a bit out there for most of us -- hard to think of use cases where you'd need be your own Amazon. But but but, in universities -- especially in universities without a heavy STEM or comp sci contingent -- there's a real possibility that the library can fill a role for computing infrastructure. As we move more and more into things that take a <em>lot</em> of space -- digital objects -- having large storage arrays locally makes more sense.</p>

<h1>OpenStack Swift</h1>

<p class="notes">We're primarily interested in Swift, which is the OpenStack S3-Alike. It's a massively scalable system in which files can be written to multiple spread out servers -- think a RAID array writ large. Most implementors of OpenStack Swift will have lots and lots of bricks. We're looking at two per site for three sites initially, in fitting with the FRU-able nature of the Backblaze pods.</p>

<h1>How OpenStack Swift (and S3, and etc) differs from traditional storage</h1>
</div>
</div><div class="slide" data-transition="none"><div class="content bullets incremental" ref="slides/02-jbfink/8">
<h1>Traditional storage:</h1>

<ul>
<li>A drive (or logical group of drives)</li>
<li>Namespace similar to existing (C:, /home)</li>
<li>Not easily expandable/adjustable</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="slide" data-transition="none"><div class="content bullets incremental" ref="slides/02-jbfink/9">
<h1>OpenStack/swift/S3</h1>

<ul>
<li><em>Not</em> mounted as traditional drive</li>
<li>Can be grown/shrunk more easily than, say, a RAID array</li>
<li>exists 'out there'</li>
<li>Is addressable via a REST interface</li>
</ul>

<p class="notes">This requires a <em>huge</em> change in how crusty old people like myself think about drives and storage. When I think storage, I think ok, I have /home or /tmp or whatever and I deal with it using UNIX commands like mv or cp. But for programming languages, this is less than ideal -- OpenStack and other RESTful things are not meant for <em>people</em> to be futzing around but programs, and it's much easier for someone to, say, write a Rails app that talks to OpenStack than to write one which has to write to a drive in the way we usually think about writing to drives.</p>
